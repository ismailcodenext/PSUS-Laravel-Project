                        challenge in the rural areas of Protidwhani Somaj Unnayan Sangstha (PSUS)â€™s operational
                        villages. Despite its importance, many families still face poor water and sanitation
                        conditions, exposing them to preventable diseases. To address this pressing issue, PSUS has
                        been implementing a comprehensive approach to improve the overall health and well-being of
                        these communities by promoting safe water practices, improving sanitation, and raising
                        awareness on personal hygiene.</p>

                            leaders. The
                            sessions focused on key health issues like the dangers of open defecation, the
                            importance of safe
                            drinking water, arsenic contamination in tube wells, and the prevention of waterborne
                            diseases such as
                            diarrhea, cholera, and jaundice. These efforts are crucial for cultivating long-term
