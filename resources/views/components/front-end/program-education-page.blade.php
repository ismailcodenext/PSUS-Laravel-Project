                <p class="program_education_desc">The primary objective of the Education for All initiative is to
                    eradicate illiteracy, particularly
                    among impoverished communities, by equipping individuals with essential literacy skills such as
                    reading and writing. This program is designed to empower individuals, especially those from
                    marginalized backgrounds, by providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to access
                    better
                    livelihood opportunities and improve their quality of life.
                    In pursuit of this goal, PSUS has undertaken a variety of initiatives aimed at promoting
                    education,
                    particularly for children and adults in non-literate households. The key activities carried out
                    under this program are as follows:

                            children's education, PSUS provided financial assistance in the form of stipends. A
                            total of <b>Tk. 43,200</b> was distributed to <b>36 students</b>, with each student

                            been
                            instrumental in easing the financial burden on families, ensuring that children can
